Things to do:
- [ ] write TODO list
- [ ] Work out what to do 

- [ ] Connect daisianne/alex's uncertainty stuff with ambers implementation - talk to amber
- [ ] Make the calculation of cones faster (more efficient) removing for loops for np arrays (will be fiddly) - talk to joe
- [ ] Explore 2d slice e.g. voxel_cube[40, :, :] and create heatmap (should be easy) maybe use matplotlib plt.imshow() - talk to joe
- [ ] Extension to previous, erosion and dilation and cutoffs for min intercepts

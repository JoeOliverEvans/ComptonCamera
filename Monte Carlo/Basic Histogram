Go to the Excel file in Folders, right click and select properties(at the bottom)
then copy everything after "Location: " and paste into file_path = ''. You will
need to write the name for the file (Experimental Data 1, in my case) manually.
You can't have the Excel file open whilst running this code otherwise it won't 
work.

NOTE: You will need to break up the data so they are not all on the A row. To
do this, select the A row. Head to the "Data" tab at the top, and click "Text
to Columns". Ensure "Delimited is ticked" and press next.
Now click the "Semicolon" tickbox, and then click finish.
